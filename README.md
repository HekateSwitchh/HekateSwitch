## Bootloader configuration

The bootloader can be configured via `bootloader/hekate_ipl.ini`. Each `.ini` section represents a boot entry, except `[config]` which defines global parameters.  

- Global configuration supports keys such as `autoboot`, `bootwait`, `autohosoff`, and others.  
- Boot entries support definitions for kernel replacement, payload launching, emuMMC pathing, RAM overclocking, and more.  

---

## Payload storage

Hekate includes an internal payload storage system, enabling configuration and execution of payloads outside of the BPMP environment.  

Key capabilities include:  
- Support for forced autoboot and menu overrides  
- Payload execution from specified storage locations  
- Integration with emuMMC pathing and ID-based entry booting
